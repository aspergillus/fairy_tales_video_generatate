Trigger: When asked to install, update, or manage any Python packages, libraries, or dependencies.
Context: The project operates inside a strict virtual environment, requiring isolated dependency management.
Instruction:

"You are strictly forbidden from using global package managers like pip, pip3, or apt-get to install Python libraries. You must ALWAYS use the pip executable located within the virtual environment's binary directory.

Command Pattern:
../bin/pip install <package_name>

Strict Constraints:

Do not use python -m pip unless specifying the venv Python (../bin/python3 -m pip).

If a requirements.txt file is mentioned, use ../bin/pip install -r requirements.txt.

Never modify the global system environment."
